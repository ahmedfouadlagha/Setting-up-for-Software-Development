# Git Setup

## Configuring Terminal
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/ahmedfouadlagha/Setting-up-for-Software-Development.git ~/
   ```
2. move the directory terminal-config to your home directory and name it .terminal-config (there's a dot at the front, now!)
   ```sh
   $ cd
   $ start .
   $ mv terminal-config .terminal-config
   ```
3. move the bash_profile file to your home directory and name it .bash_profile (there's a dot at the front, now!)
    > if you already have a .bash_profile file in your home directory, transfer the content from the downloaded bash_profile to your existing .bash_profile
   ```sh
   $ mv bash_profile .bash_profile
   ```
